# E-commerce
A frontend-only e-commerce site is a static HTML/CSS/JS product catalog. It uses local storage for a shopping cart but lacks a server-side backend. It cannot process payments, manage inventory, or handle persistent accounts. Best for demonstration, learning, or as a gallery requiring an external system for transactions.
